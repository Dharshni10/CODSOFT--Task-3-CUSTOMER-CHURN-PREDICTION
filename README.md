# CODSOFT--Task-3-CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION
This project completed during a CodSoft internship. Focuses on predicting customer churn to help businesses retain their customers and reduce losses.

## Project Overview:

### Understanding the Problem and Data Collection
The project begins with identifying the goal of predicting which customers might leave the service. Data is collected on customer demographics, usage patterns, purchase history, feedback, and other relevant details that could indicate a risk of churn.

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
The collected data is cleaned and prepared, involving steps like handling missing values and transforming data into suitable formats. New features are engineered from existing data, such as calculating average usage rates or tracking the number of complaints, to help the model better understand factors influencing churn.

### Model Development and Evaluation
Machine learning model Logistic Regression is used to predict churn. The data is split into training and testing sets to build and evaluate the model’s performance. Metrics like accuracy and precision are used to assess how well the model predicts churn.

### Model Optimization and Deployment
The model’s performance is fine-tuned through hyperparameter tuning and testing different algorithms. Once the model performs well, it is deployed in a real-world setting to make predictions on new customer data continuously.

### Actionable Insights and Continuous Monitoring
The predictions are used to take proactive steps, such as offering targeted promotions or personalized communications to at-risk customers. The model’s performance is continuously monitored to ensure it adapts to changing customer behavior, ensuring its long-term effectiveness.

## Conclusion:
The customer churn prediction project enables companies to understand and reduce churn by using data-driven insights to retain customers, improve satisfaction, and enhance overall business profitability. Applying practical machine learning techniques to solve real-world business challenges.
